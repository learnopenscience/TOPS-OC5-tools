# TOPS Core Curriculum Module 5: Open Science Tools and Resources

Welcome! This last Module provides a collection of tools that are available to increase the visibility and discoverability of your project. It complements the previous OpenCore Modules (Ethos of Open Science, Open Data, Open Software, and Open Results) by enhancing the practical implementation of the Open Science concepts explained previously. While earlier modules focused on the concepts, advantages, and disadvantages of Responsible Open Science practices, this module will focus more on the practical applications of Responsible Open Science practices. We focus on a few key tools, and highlight how they fit across the research lifecycle.
